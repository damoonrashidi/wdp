# O shit waddup
Waddup is a tool to get an aggregated developer news feed to the command line so it's available as a quick 5min update during your day.

## Installation
`λ ~/ yarn add --global wdp` or
`λ ~/ npm i -g wdp`

## Usage
`λ ~/ wdp`

Scroll through the boxes to find an item you want to read, click to select / open.

## Things I'm working on

[] Arrow keys to navigate, return to select item, N/P to jump between boxes
[] Some hacker news items won't open.. Fun bug!
[] Do something more useful/fun with the ETH/USD graph
